# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome

Welcome to the documentation for my [Github Worflows](https://github.com/alexis-gss/github-workflows) project.

Thanks to the latter, you'll learn not only the **main purpose** of this project, but also the **procedures** to follow to install.

## Introduction

This project is a repository dedicated to **github workflows**.

I've pooled all the **github actions** I use in a single project, so that I can maintain them more easily without having to update each repository individually.

## Overview

This documentation is divided into **several chapters**:

<details>

<summary>Getting started</summary>

to find out about the installation

</details>

<details>

<summary>About</summary>

to find out more about the progress of the project and more

</details>
